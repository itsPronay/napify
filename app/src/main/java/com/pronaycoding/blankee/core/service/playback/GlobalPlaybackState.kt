/**
 * Manages the global playback state of all sounds in the Blankee application.
 *
 * This class maintains a single source of truth for whether audio playback is currently enabled
 * across the entire app. It provides functionality to:
 * - Query the current playback state via [canPlay] StateFlow
 * - Set playback state and coordinate pause/resume of all sounds
 * - Toggle between play and pause states
 * - Track whether the current audio mix is audible (used for notification management)
 *
 * The playback state is backed by a [StateFlow] for reactive updates throughout the app.
 * When playback is disabled, all sounds are paused; when enabled, all previously playing sounds resume.
 *
 * @param soundManager Reference to [SoundManager] for coordinating pause/resume of all loaded sounds
 *
 * @see SoundManager for audio playback control
 * @see HomeViewmodel for ViewModel-level playback management
